MQ Points is an useful app aiming to help students and staff members in Macquarie university to redeem vouchers and buy things on campus with a better price. It provide lots of voucher options, as well as related events. Users can use this app to redeem vouchers, use vouchers, delete vouchers, view their vouchers, receive points, etc.

## MVP content

I've implemented some most important functions in deliverable 1 and improve the UI. Following is the implemented pages and functions:

* **first page**: simulate the screen when you first click on the app. It will wait 3 seconds and direct you to the login page.
* **login page**: standard login page with password checking and error messages. (For easier testing in MVP, I only check the empty input)
* **home page**: the home page is shown after you login to the app. It provide quick access buttons that will direct you to different pages.
* **shopping page**: display different kinds of vouchers.
* **voucher page**: display all vouchers you have so far, including expired vouchers.

Feature functions:

* Support dark scene mode
* Provide history checking

Testing:

* unit testing and widget testing for each screen
* integration test for some core functionalities
